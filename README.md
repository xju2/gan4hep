# gan4hep
For generating HEP events, we implemented some generative models, including
Generative Adversial Network [gan](gan4hep/gan/README.md) 
and Normaling Flow [nf](gan4hep/nf/README.md). You can also find examples
of converting trained GAN models into onnx format and performing the
inference in C++ [onnx](gan4hep/onnx/keras_examples/Readme.md).
